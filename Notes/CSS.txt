1. 3 types of writing CSS :
-> Inline CSS
-> Internal CSS
-> External CSS [This is more useful]

2. Types of Selectors :
-> Element [p, div, h1]
-> Id [#red, #green]
-> Class [.blue, .yellow]
-> Group []
-> Child Selector - when it is direct child of the parent element [div > p]
-> Desendant Selector - When it is not direct child of the parent element [div p]
-> Universal Selector [*]
-> Psuedo Selector [a:visited, a:link, a:active, a:hover, p:first-child]

3. CSS Box Model :
content > padding > border > margin

4. Fonts, Text, Color :
-> font-style, font-size, font-family, font-weight
-> text-transform, text-decoration, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, text-indent, text-overflow, overflow
-> line-height, text-align, word-break

5. CSS Sizing Units
-> px : 1/96th of 1inch
-> vw : viewport's width
-> vh : viewport's height
-> rem & em : em inherits from the parent element & rem inherits from the root element.
-> vmin & vmax : it will take the min or max of width and height (for eg: for desktop vmin=vh,vmax=vw)
-> % : it will take width of its parent

6. Display properties
-> Inline
-> Inline-block
-> display : none (element including its space nothing will be shown) , visibility : hidden (element will be there just it will not show up)

7. Shadows & Outlines
-> box-shadow
-> text-shadow
-> Outline : is not a part of Box-Model whereas Border is part of Box-Model

8. CSS overflow
-> This will help to stop overflow of the content from the container
-> overflow : auto, scroll;
-> white-space : nowrap; - This will not allow the content to scroll vertically

9. Position Property
-> Stactic : its by default and you can add any position property on it.
-> Relative : It is relative position to itself(the element) and can give top,left,right etc.
-> Absolute : It is positioned to nearest positioned parent
-> Fixed : It will be fixed in the website 
-> Sticky : It will stick to the top or bottom

10. CSS Variables
-> we can use this to define the global properties of the website syntax is :
:root{
    --color : rgb();
    --seccolor : rgb();
}

11. Media Query
-> used to style differently on mobile, laptop device
syntax :
@media not|only mediatype and(expressions) {
    CSS Code
}
